## Milestone 1: Foundation (P0)
**Timeline:** Week 1
**Definition of Done:** Next.js + Convex app deploys to Vercel; schema live; PostHog capturing page views; CI green.

### Setup & Infrastructure
- [x] P0 Scaffold Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind) in repo
- [x] P0 Add Convex; connect dev deployment; env var handling documented (local dev deployment; cloud deployment at M2/M6)
- [x] P0 Deploy skeleton to Vercel (hobby tier), verify production build (live: https://perfectbundle.vercel.app — landing + /quiz verified 2026-07-17)
- [x] P0 GitHub repo + GitHub Actions CI (typecheck, lint, unit tests)
- [x] P0 Install Framer Motion, Zod, PostHog JS
- [ ] P1 Error tracking via Sentry free tier (or Vercel logs initially) — deferred, Vercel logs for now

### Database & Schema
- [x] P0 Define Convex schema: bundles, curatedBundles, generationCache, engagementCounters, rateLimits (see docs/data-schema.md)
- [x] P0 Seed script: 5 sample curated bundles for dev (idempotent, verified on local deployment)
- [x] P0 PostHog project created; `page_view` with UTM capture verified — confirmed via M3 closeout 2026-07-20: PostHog API showed real `$pageview` events with recent timestamps

**Dependencies:** None
**Blockers to watch:** none known

## Milestone 2: Core MVP — P0 Features
**Timeline:** Weeks 2–4
**Definition of Done:** Guest can quiz → get 3 bundles → click retailer links → share a bundle; trending page browsable; all on production URL.

### Quiz Wizard (F1) — ✅ complete 2026-07-17 (plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-m2-quiz-wizard.md)
- [x] P0 Quiz state model + step framework (back-nav preserves answers) — pure `src/lib/quiz/machine.ts`, 18 unit tests
- [x] P0 Steps: occasion → recipient basics → interests (chips + free text) → budget → urgency → exclusions
- [x] P0 Country auto-detect (navigator.language/locale) with manual override — `src/lib/quiz/country.ts`
- [x] P0 Mobile-responsive layout (360px) + Framer Motion transitions
- [x] P0 Events: quiz_started, quiz_step_completed, quiz_completed (via src/lib/analytics.ts track())
- Note: ends at `/quiz/results` stub reading sessionStorage `pb.quizAnswers`; bundle engine sprint consumes it next. Playwright click-through deferred to M5.

### Bundle Engine (F2) — ✅ complete 2026-07-17 (plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-m2-link-builder-engine.md)
- [x] P0 Zod schemas for engine output (bundles → items) — already existed from M1, reused as-is
- [x] P0 "Gift intelligence" system prompt v1 (coherence, budget respect, exclusions, age rails) — `src/lib/engine/prompt.ts`
- [x] P0 Convex action: quiz → Gemini Flash call → validated JSON (1 retry on invalid) — `convex/generateBundles.ts` (`generate` action), model `gemini-flash-latest`
- [x] P0 Generation cache by normalized quiz hash — `src/lib/quiz/hash.ts` (order-independent FNV-1a) + `convex/generationCache.ts`, verified cache hit on repeat quiz
- [x] P0 Per-IP/user rate limiting — `convex/rateLimit.ts`, 10/hour fixed window
- [x] P0 Quota-exhausted fallback → trending bundles + friendly message — engine returns typed `{status:"failed"|"rate_limited"}`; UI wiring done, see Bundle Results UI section below
- [x] P0 Golden-fixture eval suite (budget bounds, exclusions, age rails) — `src/lib/engine/golden-fixtures.test.ts`
- [x] P0 Events: bundles_generated, bundle_generation_failed — already in `src/lib/analytics.ts` union from M1; fired by results UI next sprint
- Verified live end-to-end with real Gemini call (2026-07-17): 3 coherent themed bundles, budget respected (£35-53 vs £50 target), "candles" exclusion respected across all 9 items, correct GBP currency.
- Also added `convex/bundles.ts` `getByIds` query — thin client-callable surface the results UI will use next.

### Link Builder (F3) — ✅ complete 2026-07-17
- [x] P0 Pure function: searchQuery + country → Amazon(TLD map)/Etsy/eBay URLs — `src/lib/links/retailer-links.ts`, 16 countries + .com fallback
- [x] P0 Affiliate-tag slots via config (empty for now) — `AFFILIATE_TAG_AMAZON`/`AFFILIATE_ID_EBAY` env-driven, unset today
- [x] P0 Fast-shipping hint params for high urgency — Amazon "Get It Fast" refinement param
- [x] P0 Exhaustive unit tests (≥15 countries, fallbacks) — 16/16 in test suite
- [x] P0 Event: retailer_link_clicked — fires from `<BundleCard>` on retailer link click

### Bundle Results UI (F2/F4) — ✅ mostly complete 2026-07-17 (plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-m2-results-share-trending.md)
- [x] P0 3-bundle results page: theme, items, "why this fits", est. totals vs budget — `src/app/quiz/results/page.tsx` + `<BundleCard>`
- [x] P1 Item swap ("show me another") — done 2026-07-20, see Backlog section
- [x] P0 Whole-bundle regenerate — "Start over" (re-runs the quiz) plus true per-card regenerate, done 2026-07-20 (see Backlog section)
- [x] P0 Loading/error/retry states (never dead-ends) — "Building your bundles…" loading state; failure/rate-limit falls back to curated trending bundles inline, verified live by disabling the Gemini key
- [x] P0 Events: item_swapped, bundle_regenerated — now firing live, see Backlog section (2026-07-20)

### Share (F5) — ✅ complete 2026-07-17
- [x] P0 Persist bundle → public `/b/<id>` page (no auth required) — `convex/bundles.ts` `makePublic`/`getPublic` + `src/app/b/[id]/page.tsx` (Server Component, `fetchQuery`)
- [x] P0 OG meta tags for social previews — `generateMetadata` using bundle theme/rationale; **OG/Twitter preview images added 2026-07-22** — `src/app/opengraph-image.tsx` (site-wide default) + `src/app/b/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx` (dynamic, shows the bundle's theme), both via Next's built-in `next/og` `ImageResponse` (free, no external service). Shared links previously rendered as bare text on Reddit/iMessage/Twitter — no image meant much lower click-through on the core share loop.
- [x] P0 Events: bundle_shared, shared_bundle_viewed — verified live: share → clipboard copy → `/b/<id>` renders real content server-side; malformed/private id gracefully shows "isn't available"

### Trending (F6) — ✅ P0 scope complete 2026-07-17
- [x] P0 Trending page listing curated bundles — `src/app/trending/page.tsx`, linked from landing page
- [x] P0 Admin script: generate curated candidates via engine → owner approves into curatedBundles — done at M1 via `convex/seedData.ts` (5 hand-authored bundles); a generator *script* (as opposed to hand-authoring) is optional tooling, not required for P0
- [x] P0 Seed 20–30 curated bundles before launch — grown from 5 to 23 (2026-07-22 content batch via `seedAdditionalCurated`, idempotent by title); within target range
- [x] P0 Events: trending_viewed, curated_bundle_opened

**Dependencies:** Milestone 1
**Blockers to watch:** Gemini API key setup; prompt quality iteration time

---

## Milestone 3: Analytics & Proof Dashboard
**Timeline:** Week 4 (overlaps M2 tail)
**Definition of Done:** Full event spine verified firing; PostHog dashboards built per docs/dashboard-spec.md.

- [x] P0 Verify every §2.3 PRD event fires with correct properties — confirmed live via PostHog API 2026-07-20: `event_definitions` lists all M2/M3 events with recent `last_seen_at` timestamps; a real funnel query returned genuine conversion data (9 `$pageview` → 5 `quiz_started` → 4 `quiz_completed` → 3 `bundles_generated` → 2 `retailer_link_clicked`), proving both correct firing and correct property shape end-to-end. M4 events (`signup`, `bundle_saved`, `profile_created`, `reminder_set`) exist in code but have 0 occurrences yet — expected, those features only just went live this session
- [x] P0 PostHog funnel: page_view → quiz_started → quiz_completed → bundles_generated → retailer_link_clicked — built via PostHog API (see below), two variants (breakdown by device, by utm_source)
- [x] P0 Headline metrics dashboard (bundles/week, completion %, CTR, shares) — built via PostHog API 2026-07-20: "PerfectBundle Proof Dashboard" (pinned), 12 insights covering every `docs/dashboard-spec.md` section except Revenue (P2/manual by design) and Alerts (optional polish). Built programmatically with a personal API key rather than by hand — owner generated a scoped key (Insight/Dashboard write, Event definition read), no dependency on manual PostHog UI work going forward for insight changes
- [x] P0 Channel attribution insight (by utm_source incl. share links) — "Sessions & quiz starts by UTM source" (breakdown by `utm_source`) + "Share loop: viewed shared bundle → started quiz" funnel filtered to `utm_source=share`
- [x] P1 Convex engagementCounters wired (clicks/saves/shares per bundle) — `convex/engagement.ts` `record` mutation fired fire-and-forget from link-click/save/share/view touchpoints (both curated + generated); `src/lib/bundles/popularity.ts` pure scorer (plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-m4-popular-tab.md)

**Dependencies:** Milestone 2 features emitting events

---

## Milestone 4: Accounts & Retention — P1 Features
**Timeline:** Weeks 5–6
**Definition of Done:** Sign up, save, profiles, reminders all work in production; Popular tab live.

### Auth & Saved Bundles (F7)
- [x] P1 Clerk integration — email auth live in production (`src/proxy.ts`, `ClerkProvider`, sign-in/sign-up pages, site header). Google OAuth confirmed live 2026-07-20 (`connection_oauth_google.enabled: true`, verified via both `clerk config pull` and the live Frontend API `/v1/environment`) — uses Clerk's shared dev credentials, no Google Cloud setup needed since the app still runs on Clerk's dev instance in production
- [x] P1 Save bundle (guest → signup upsell at save action) — `savedBundles` table + Convex CRUD, `SaveButton` opens Clerk modal for guests / toggles for members; Convex↔Clerk auth wired (`convex/auth.config.ts`, `ConvexProviderWithClerk`, "convex" JWT template w/ `aud` claim)
- [x] P1 "My bundles" page — `/my-bundles`, header link for signed-in users
- [x] P1 Events: `bundle_saved` fires on save. `signup` fires via a Clerk `user.created` webhook (`src/app/api/webhooks/clerk/route.ts`) — server-truth, exactly-once regardless of signup entry point (header button, save-upsell modal, or `/sign-up` page). Verified fully working end-to-end 2026-07-20 (webhook registered, signing secret pushed to Vercel, confirmed via a live test signup landing in PostHog).

> **Monetization strategy:** see `docs/monetization.md` (affiliate-first, phased, $0-to-run).

### Recipient Profiles (F7)
- [x] P1 Profile CRUD (name, age, interests, notes) — `convex/recipientProfiles.ts` (auth-gated, ownership-checked), `/profiles` page, `ProfileForm` reused for create/edit
- [x] P1 One-click "new bundles for X" with pre-filled quiz — `src/lib/quiz/prefill.ts` (unit-tested) seeds the same sessionStorage the quiz hydrates from; person-level fields prefilled, occasion/budget/urgency left for the user to redo per gift
- [x] P1 Past-bundle memory dedupes future suggestions — `pastItemNames` on `recipientProfiles`, threaded via `QuizState.profileId` (kept out of `QuizAnswers`/cache hash), `generateBundles.generate` fetches+excludes past items in the prompt and appends new ones after a fresh (non-cached) generation; cache key folds in profileId to prevent a stale hit bypassing dedup (plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-m4-past-bundle-memory.md)
- [x] P1 Event: profile_created fires on save

### Occasion Reminders (F7)
- [ ] P1 Reminder CRUD (dates attached to profiles)
- [ ] P1 Daily Convex cron: find T-14/T-3 reminders → Resend email with deep link
- [ ] P1 Resend free-tier guard (daily batch cap + usage logging)
- [ ] P1 Events: reminder_set, reminder_email_sent, reminder_email_clicked

### Popular Tab (F6)
- [x] P1 Engagement score ranking from engagementCounters — `src/lib/bundles/popularity.ts` (pure, unit-tested; `3·clicks + 2·saves + 2·shares + views`), `convex/engagement.ts` `listPopular`
- [x] P1 Popular tab UI alongside Trending — `/popular` ranks publicly-shared user-generated bundles (distinct from editorial `/trending`); cross-linked both ways; graceful cold-start empty state (plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-m4-popular-tab.md)

### Monetization Prep
- [x] P1 Apply: eBay Partner Network (approved + campaign ID live 2026-07-20), Amazon Associates (approved, tag live). Awin (Etsy) moot — Etsy's app was rejected and Etsy removed from the codebase.
- [x] P1 Flip affiliate tags via config when approved — Amazon done 2026-07-19; eBay campaign ID (`AFFILIATE_ID_EBAY` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_AFFILIATE_ID_EBAY`) set on Convex prod + Vercel 2026-07-20

### Product images & buyable links (spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-18-product-data-and-images-design.md)
> **Updated 2026-07-18 (evening): eBay + Amazon APPROVED; Etsy rejected → removed entirely.** This reopens the direct-retailer route: eBay's Browse API can supply real product photos + direct links, and Amazon Associates tags can now be flipped on. Sovrn remains a useful aggregator fallback but is no longer the only path. Representative images (Unsplash primary, Pexels fallback) cover everything either way.
- [x] Remove Etsy from the link builder + tests + docs (app rejected) — regression test asserts no Etsy link can reappear
- [x] Phase 1: Representative item images — **Unsplash primary + Pexels fallback** (env-gated `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY` / `PEXELS_API_KEY`), fetched + cached at generation time, rendered with a "Representative image" caption **and photographer attribution** ("Photo by X on Unsplash" — required by Unsplash's API terms); pure media module unit-tested (`src/lib/engine/media.ts`), best-effort (never blocks generation). Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-phase1-representative-images.md
- [x] eBay Browse API (APPROVED) — real product photo + direct item URL + price now live via `parseEbayItemSummary` + `fetchEbayProduct` (`convex/generateBundles.ts`), layered ahead of representative images through `chooseItemMedia({ realProduct, stock })`. OAuth client-credentials token fetched once per generation (`getEbayToken`). **Verified live**: a real generation returned real eBay photo+price+direct-buy-link for every item across all 3 bundles. Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-19-ebay-real-products-affiliate-fix.md
- [x] Flip Amazon Associates tag (APPROVED) — found and fixed a real pre-existing bug in the process: `retailer-links.ts` (called from the `"use client"` `BundleCard`) read a non-`NEXT_PUBLIC_` env var, which Next.js never inlines into the browser bundle, so the tag never reached outbound links even when set. Renamed to `NEXT_PUBLIC_AFFILIATE_TAG_AMAZON` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_AFFILIATE_ID_EBAY`; regression-tested.
- [~] Phase 2: Sovrn Product API — real product photo + direct affiliate buy link + price + merchant.
  - [x] UI done: primary "Buy at {merchant}" affiliate button + real price + FTC affiliate disclosure (renders whenever an item has `productUrl`); layering already supports Sovrn (`chooseItemMedia`). Tested via `tests/e2e/affiliate-buy.spec.ts`.
  - [ ] Sovrn fetch + `parseSovrnProduct` — BLOCKED: live API returns 401 "Invalid Api Key" (campaign not yet approved and/or key mis-copied), and Sovrn doesn't publish the response schema, so the parser can't be written until one authenticated call succeeds. Owner: confirm the Sovrn campaign is "Approved" and the site-key/secret are correct, then I hit the API once to learn the shape and finish this.

**Dependencies:** Milestones 2–3
**Blockers to watch:** affiliate program approval timelines (external); Phase 2 needs owner's Sovrn key

---

## Milestone 5: Testing & Polish
**Timeline:** Week 7
**Definition of Done:** Playwright E2E ≥95% pass; golden fixtures green; Lighthouse ≥90 mobile.

- [x] P0 Playwright E2E: quiz → bundles → link click — `tests/e2e/quiz-flow.spec.ts` (docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-m5-playwright-e2e.md), 8/8 passing
- [x] P0 Playwright E2E: share flow (create + open public link) — `tests/e2e/share.spec.ts` (seeds via test-only Convex mutation, not a live click-through, to stay fast/deterministic/quota-free)
- [x] P1 Playwright E2E: signup → save → profile — `tests/e2e/auth-flow.spec.ts`, uses `@clerk/testing`'s `clerk.signIn()` against a throwaway Clerk user created via the Backend API (not a real sign-up-form click-through — that's Clerk's own tested surface), bundle seeded via `testSupport:seedPopularBundle` to spend zero extra Gemini quota. `regenerate` isn't covered yet — that's per-bundle regenerate, a separate not-yet-built feature (see Backlog); extend this test once it exists.
- [x] P0 Golden-fixture engine suite in CI — `src/lib/engine/golden-fixtures.test.ts` (added M2), runs via `npm test` in GitHub Actions CI
- [x] P0 Cross-browser + mobile viewport pass — chromium, firefox, webkit, mobile-chrome (Pixel 7) all covered via `tests/e2e/` (docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-17-m5-cross-browser-a11y.md); the one Gemini-calling test intentionally runs on chromium only (quota-conscious, `test.skip` on other projects) — 41 passed, 3 skipped
- [x] P1 Lighthouse ≥90 (performance, a11y) on quiz + results — run 2026-07-22 against a production build (`next build && next start`; dev-mode scores are unrepresentatively low). Found and fixed 2 real a11y bugs shared across every page using `<BundleCard>` (heading order: theme was `<h3>` with no `<h2>` in between any `<h1>`→card path; color contrast: several `opacity-50` captions/disclosure text scored 3.4:1, below the 4.5:1 minimum — bumped to `opacity-60`). Results: **/quiz/results — Performance 94, Accessibility 100** (audited with real generated content: 8 real eBay/Unsplash images, via a one-off Puppeteer+Lighthouse-Node-API script to get past the page's sessionStorage-gated content, since a cold Lighthouse CLI run only ever sees the "no answers" empty state). **/quiz — Accessibility 100, Performance 74** (below target) — root-caused via direct audit inspection: dominated by Clerk's dev-instance "handshake" redirect (~1.7s, only happens cold/pre-cookie) plus ~230KiB of eagerly-loaded Clerk UI + PostHog session-recorder JS. Both are consequences of decisions already made this session (stay on Clerk dev keys + vercel.app, no custom domain) rather than app-code bugs — a Clerk *production* instance would remove the handshake entirely but requires DNS control of a real domain. Not pursued further without revisiting that decision. Verified: Vitest 132/132, `tsc --noEmit` clean, full Playwright suite 71 passed/6 skipped (confirms the heading-level change doesn't break any `getByRole("heading")` assertions).
- [x] P1 Accessibility audit (keyboard nav, contrast, labels) — baseline axe-core scan (serious/critical impact threshold) on landing, quiz, trending, passing across all 4 browser projects. Found and fixed a real WCAG contrast issue: the landing headline's Framer Motion fade-in could render at transiently low contrast — fixed by adding site-wide `prefers-reduced-motion` support (`src/components/motion-config-provider.tsx`)
- Note: the E2E suite (`npm run test:e2e`) runs locally only — auto-starts both `npx convex dev` and `npm run dev` via Playwright's `webServer` config, no manual two-terminal setup needed. NOT yet wired into GitHub Actions CI (would need a CI-safe Gemini key/quota strategy — deferred).
- Bug caught by E2E testing and fixed: `submit()` in `src/components/quiz/use-quiz.ts` was calling `router.push()` from inside a `setState` updater, triggering a React warning; fixed by reading state from closure instead.

**Dependencies:** Milestones 1–4 (M4 items above excepted, correctly still pending)

---

## Milestone 6: Launch
**Timeline:** Week 8
**Definition of Done:** Public URL, indexed, monitored; launch posts out.

- [x] P0 Production env vars audit (no secrets client-side) — done 2026-07-20. `grep`'d every `process.env.*` read in `src/` (client-reachable code): all are `NEXT_PUBLIC_`-prefixed, and everything under that prefix in `.env.local` is a genuinely public value (Convex URL, PostHog project key/host, Clerk publishable key, affiliate tags) — no real secret is mistakenly public. Cross-checked `npx convex env list --prod --names-only` against every server-only env read in `convex/*.ts`: exact match, nothing missing or unexpected. `next.config.ts` has no `env:` block that could leak a server var into the client bundle.
- [ ] P1 Custom domain (only cost allowed: ~$10/yr domain — optional, can launch on vercel.app for $0)
- [x] P0 SEO basics: meta, sitemap, robots; OG images — `src/app/robots.ts`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, root layout OG metadata + `metadataBase`; share pages already had per-bundle OG tags from M2. (Note: sitemap/OG hardcode `perfectbundle.vercel.app` — update if a custom domain is added later.)
- [ ] P0 Uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot free) — needs owner's UptimeRobot account
- [ ] P1 Launch posts (Reddit/X/Product Hunt) with UTM links
- [ ] P0 48-hour post-launch watch: quota usage, errors, funnel

**Dependencies:** Milestone 5

---

## Backlog (Future Phases)
- [x] P1 Single-item swap ("show me another") — `buildItemSwapPrompt`/`parseItemResponse` (`src/lib/engine/`), `generateBundles:swapItem` Convex action, `BundleCard` "🔄 Show me another" per-item button. Fires `item_swapped`. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-20-item-swap-bundle-regenerate.md`
- [x] P1 Per-bundle regenerate (distinct from whole-quiz "Start over") — `buildBundleRegeneratePrompt`/`parseSingleBundleResponse`, `generateBundles:regenerateBundle` Convex action, `BundleCard` "🔄 Regenerate" per-bundle button. Fires `bundle_regenerated`. Same plan as above.
- [ ] P2 `<BundleCard>` shows curated bundles' `theme` (descriptive tagline) as its heading, not the catchier admin-facing `title` field (e.g. "Slow coffee mornings" instead of "The Coffee Ritual") — found via E2E test writing; minor polish, not a functional bug (generated bundles have no separate title field, so this is consistent behavior, just not the punchiest copy for curated/trending)
- [ ] P2 eBay Browse API: live prices/deals where available
- [ ] P2 Engine learning from click data (boost item types that get clicks)
- [ ] P2 React Native (Expo) iOS/Android apps sharing Convex backend
- [ ] P2 Premium tier via RevenueCat (unlimited profiles/reminders)
- [ ] P2 Affiliate revenue table + monthly import (docs/prd.md §4.4)
- [ ] P3 In-app checkout / middleman purchasing (parked: payments, refunds, tax — needs real traffic first)
- [ ] P3 Non-English UI localization

---

## Notes

### Assumptions
- Gemini free tier remains available at useful quota; engine interface keeps provider swappable
- Organic/social acquisition only (no ad budget)
- Owner time ~part-time; timelines are elastic

### Risks
- Gemini quota/terms: cache + rate limit + fallback (PRD §8)
- Affiliate approvals slow: launch without tags, links pre-wired
- Retailer URL format drift: isolated, unit-tested link builder

### Out of Scope (current)
- In-app purchasing/dropshipping, live price guarantees, native apps, localization (see PRD)

## Milestone Dependencies
```
M1 Foundation → M2 Core MVP → M3 Analytics → M4 Accounts/Retention → M5 Testing → M6 Launch
                     (M3 overlaps M2 tail)
```

## Coordination
This file is the only place tasks live. Sessions and subagents edit it directly. Per-feature execution detail lives in `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md` (written by `superpowers:writing-plans`); this file stays the high-level roadmap.
